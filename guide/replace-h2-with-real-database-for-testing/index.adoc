In this guide you will learn how to

* Replace an H2 in-memory database that is used for testing with the same type of database that you use in production
* How to use the special Testcontainers JDBC URL to use database containers
* Use the Testcontainers JUnit 5 Extension to initialize database
* Test Spring Data JPA and JdbcTemplate based repositories

== Prerequisites
* Java 17+ / Go 1.20+ / Node 16.x etc
* Your favorite IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, VS Code)
* A Docker environment supported by Testcontainers https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/

== What we are going to achieve in this guide

We are going to create a sample SpringBoot application using *Spring Data JPA* and *PostgreSQL*.
We will take a look at the common practice of using an H2 in-memory database for testing and
understand the downsides of this approach. Then we will learn how we can replace this approach
by testing with the same type of database (PostgreSQL in our case) that we use in production
using Testcontainers JDBC URL. Finally, we will look into how we can use the same approach for testing
*JdbcTemplate* based repositories as well.

== Getting Started
You can create a new Spring Boot project from https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] by selecting
the *Spring Data JPA*, *JDBC API*, *PostgreSQL Driver*, *H2 Database* and *Testcontainers* starters.

== Create JPA Entity and Spring Data JPA Repository

First let us start with creating a JPA entity *Product.java*.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name = "products")
public class Product {
   @Id
   private Long id;

   @Column(nullable = false, unique = true)
   private String code;

   @Column(nullable = false)
   private String name;

   // setters and getters
}
----

Let us create a Spring Data JPA repository interface for the *Product* entity.

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {
}
----

== Testing with H2 in-memory database

One of the approaches for testing database repositories is using lightweight databases such as H2 or HSQL
as in-memory databases while using a different database like PostgreSQL, MySQL or Oracle in production.

The drawbacks of using a different database for testing are:

* The test database might not support all the features of your production database
* The SQL query syntax might not be compatible with both in-memory database and your production database.
* Testing with a different database than what you use for production will not give you complete confidence in your test suite.

But still, in-memory databases like H2 are being predominantly used for testing because of their ease of use.

Let us see how we can write tests for our *ProductRepository* using H2.

[source,java]
----
@DataJpaTest
class ProductRepositoryTest {

   @Autowired
   ProductRepository productRepository;

   @Test
   @Sql("classpath:/sql/seed-data.sql")
   void shouldGetAllProducts() {
       List<Product> products = productRepository.findAll();
       assertEquals(2, products.size());
   }
}
----

If you run this test, by default Spring Boot is going to use an in-memory database if any in-memory database
driver is available on classpath. As we have added the H2 database driver,
the *ProductRepositoryTest* will be executed using the H2 in-memory database.

We are using the *@Sql* annotation provided by Spring to initialize sample data required for our test,
calling the repository method and asserting the expected result.

But the challenge comes when we want to use features supported only by our production database,
but not by H2 database.

For example, let us imagine we want to implement a feature where we want to create a new product
if a product with given code does not already exist, otherwise donâ€™t create a new product.

In PostgreSQL we can implement this using the following query:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO products(id, code, name) VALUES(?,?,?) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
----

But the same query doesn't work with H2 by default.
When you execute the above query with H2 then you will get the following exception:

[source,shell]
----
Caused by: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Syntax error in SQL statement "INSERT INTO products (id, code, name) VALUES (?, ?, ?) ON[*] CONFLICT DO NOTHING";"
----

You can run H2 with PostgreSQL compatibility mode to support PostgreSQL syntax
but still not all the features are supported by H2.

The inverse scenario is also possible where some query works fine with H2 but not in PostgreSQL.
For example, H2 supports the *ROWNUM()* function where PostgreSQL doesn't.
So even if you write tests for repositories using H2 database there is no guarantee that your code works
in the same way with the production database, and you will need to verify after deploying your application
which defeats the whole purpose of writing automated tests.

Now, let us see how simple it is to replace the H2 database with a real Postgres database for testing using Testcontainers.

== Testing with PostgreSQL database using Testcontainers
In order to test with a PostgreSQL database instead of H2 database, we need to turn-off autoconfiguration of
in-memory database and use Testcontainers *special JDBC URL* as the DataSource URL.

[source,java]
----
@DataJpaTest
@TestPropertySource(properties = {
  "spring.test.database.replace=none",
  "spring.datasource.url=jdbc:tc:postgresql:15.2-alpine:///db"
})
class ProductRepositoryTest {

   @Autowired
   private ProductRepository productRepository;

   @Test
   @Sql("classpath:/sql/seed-data.sql")
   void shouldGetAllProducts() {
       List<Product> products = productRepository.findAll();
       assertEquals(2, products.size());
   }
}
----

Now if you run the test, you can see in the console logs that our test is using a PostgreSQL database
instead of the H2 in-memory database. *It is as simple as that!*

Let us understand how this test works.

We have turned-off the autoconfiguration of *DataSource* bean using in-memory database by
adding *spring.test.database.replace=none* property and configured *spring.datasource.url* property
to the special Testcontainers JDBC URL.

If we have Testcontainers and the appropriate JDBC driver on the classpath, we can simply use
the special JDBC connection URLs to get a fresh containerized instance of the database each time
the application starts up.

The actual PostgreSQL JDBC URL looks like: *jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres*

To get the special JDBC URL, insert *tc:* after *jdbc:* as follows.
(Note that the hostname, port and database name will be ignored;
so you can leave these as-is or set them to any value.)

[source]
----
jdbc:tc:postgresql:///db
----

We can also indicate which version of PostgreSQL database to use by specifying the Docker image tag after *postgresql* as follows:

[source]
----
jdbc:tc:postgresql:15.2-alpine:///db
----

Here we have appended the tag *15.2-alpine* to *postgresql* so that our test will use a PostgreSQL container
created from *postgres:15.2-alpine* image.

You can also initialize the database using a SQL script by passing *TC_INITSCRIPT* parameter as follows:

[source]
----
jdbc:tc:postgresql:15.2-alpine:///db?TC_INITSCRIPT=sql/init-db.sql
----

Testcontainers will automatically execute the SQL script that was specified using the *TC_INITSCRIPT* parameter.
However, ideally you should be using a proper database migration tool like *Flyway* or *Liquibase*.

The special JDBC URL also works for other databases such as *MySQL*, *PostGIS*, *YugabyteDB*, *CockroachDB* etc.

== Initializing the database container using Testcontainers and JUnit

If using special JDBC URL doesn't meet your needs, or you need more control over the container creation,
then you can use the JUnit 5 Testcontainers Extension as follows:

[source,java]
----
@DataJpaTest
@TestPropertySource(properties = {
    "spring.test.database.replace=none"
})
@Testcontainers
class ProductRepositoryTest {

   @Container
   static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres =
      new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:15.2-alpine")
           .withCopyFileToContainer(
               MountableFile.forClasspathResource("sql/init-db.sql"),
               "/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-db.sql");

   @DynamicPropertySource
   static void configureProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {
       registry.add("spring.datasource.url", postgres::getJdbcUrl);
       registry.add("spring.datasource.username", postgres::getUsername);
       registry.add("spring.datasource.password", postgres::getPassword);
   }

   @Autowired
   ProductRepository productRepository;

   @Test
   @Sql("/sql/seed-data.sql")
   void shouldGetAllProducts() {
       List<Product> products = productRepository.findAll();
       assertEquals(2, products.size());
   }
}
----

Here we have used the Testcontainers JUnit 5 extension annotations *@Testcontainers* and *@Container*
to start *PostgreSQLContainer* and registered the datasource properties with Spring Boot using
the dynamic property registration method through the *@DynamicPropertySource* annotation.

== Testing JdbcTemplate based repositories
In the previous section we have seen how to test Spring Data JPA repositories with a real database
using Testcontainers. The same approach works for repositories using *JdbcTemplate* as well.

[source,java]
----
@JdbcTest
@TestPropertySource(properties = {
  "spring.test.database.replace=none",
  "spring.datasource.url=jdbc:tc:postgresql:15.2-alpine:///db?TC_INITSCRIPT=sql/init-db.sql"
})
class JdbcProductRepositoryTest {

   @Autowired
   private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

   private JdbcProductRepository productRepo;

   @BeforeEach
   void setUp() {
       productRepo = new JdbcProductRepository(jdbcTemplate);
   }

   @Test
   @Sql("classpath:/sql/seed-data.sql")
   void shouldGetAllProducts() {
       List<Product> products = productRepo.getAllProducts();
       assertEquals(2, products.size());
   }
}
----

We are using Spring Boot JDBC slice test annotation *@JdbcTest* to test the *JdbcTemplate* based repository
and configured the Testcontainers special JDBC URL just as we did for the Spring Data JPA repository tests.
This test will run by using the PostgreSQL database container created from the *postgres:15.2-alpine* image
and initialized by running the *sql/init-db.sql* script.

== Summary
We have looked into how to test Spring Data JPA repositories using H2 in-memory database and talked about
the drawbacks of using different (in-memory) databases for testing while using a different type of database
in production.

Then we learned about how simply we can replace H2 database with a real database for testing using
Testcontainers special JDBC URL. We also looked at using Testcontainers JUnit 5 extension annotations
to spin up the database for testing which gives more control over the lifecycle of the database container.
